# Fabric validation of compute nodes using Message Passing Interface (MPI) performance tools

This section provides an overview of validating a compute node endpoint using a range of available MPI performance tools.
These tools encompass tools developed by HPE and open source alternatives.
By following a systematic process outlined in this section, failures can be identified and isolated at an early stage.

The underlying principle of this process is that the overall health of the system depends on the health of all groups.
To ensure a group's health, it is essential that all switches and endpoints within that group are also healthy.
