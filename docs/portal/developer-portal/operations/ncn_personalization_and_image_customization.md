# Non-compute Node (NCN) personalization and image customization

NCN personalization and image customization are both methods used to configure NCNs. Which method you must use depends on the version of CSM on the system.

NCN personalization is the process of applying product-specific configuration to NCNs post-boot.
NCN image customization is the process of applying product-specific configuration to an NCN image prior to boot.
It must be run on the NCN worker node image to ensure that the appropriate SHS CFS layer is applied.

Select one of the following procedures depending on the version of CSM in use:

- **CSM 1.2 or earlier versions**: Proceed to the [NCN personalization](ncn_personalization.md#ncn-personalization) procedure.
- **CSM 1.3 or later versions**: Proceed to the [NCN image customization](ncn_image_customization.md#ncn-image-customization) procedure.
