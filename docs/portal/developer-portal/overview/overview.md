# Overview

SHS includes drivers and diagnostics for the HPE Slingshot NIC (CXI device driver), OFI Libfabric libraries for the HPE Slingshot NIC, as well as Linux configuration utilities and sample code for configuring the host images.

For systems using the Cray Operating System (COS), SHS packages also supply drivers for the supported industry standard NICs. For supported industry standard NICs, Libfabric is supplied as it is required by Cray MPI. These components are installed on each node connected to the HPE Slingshot network and should be integrated into the boot images.

**Note:** For upgrade instructions for SHS, see the installation sections. Upgrading SHS involves installing a newer image, so specific upgrade instructions are not provided separately.
