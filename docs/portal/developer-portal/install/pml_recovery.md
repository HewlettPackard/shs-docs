# Configure PML recovery

Starting in the Slingshot Host Software (SHS) 11.1.0 release, PML recovery is supported for edge links. Edge links of earlier SHS versions will flap instead of recovering.

**Note:** PML recovery is only available for HPE Slingshot 200Gbps NICs; it is not available for Mellanox NICs.

PML recovery is disabled by default and must be enabled on the fabric before configuring it on the host. See the [PML recovery on the fabric](#./pml-recovery-on-the-fabric) section.

PML recovery enables links to recover from transient faults that would otherwise cause the link to flap, without packet loss and only a brief delay in transmission. This can stabilize the fabric by reducing occasional random disruptions.

Links that frequently PML recover require hardware action like repeat flappers. Monitor `HsnPmlRecoveryDetected` and `HsnLinkFlapDetected` Redfish events to identify maintenance candidates.
See the "PML recovery summary events" section of the _HPE Slingshot Administration Guide_ for more information.

Recovery must be enabled on both ends of a link. Use `ethtool` to enable it on the host as follows.

```screen
ethtool --set-priv-flags <hsn-iface> disable-pml-recovery off
```

## PML recovery on the fabric

PML recovery is available for the HPE Slingshot fabric.
See the "Configure PML recovery" section in the _HPE Slingshot Installation Guide_ for the environment you are installing.
