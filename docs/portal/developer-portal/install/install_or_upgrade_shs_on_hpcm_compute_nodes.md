# Install Slingshot Host Software (SHS) on HPCM compute nodes

This documentation provides step-by-step instructions to install and/or upgrade HPE Slingshot Host Software (SHS) on compute node images on an HPE Performance Cluster Manager (HPCM) using SLES15-SP4 as an example.

The procedure outlined here is applicable to SLES and RHEL distributions.
See the "System Software Requirements for HPE Slingshot Host Software (SHS)" section in the _HPE Slingshot Host Software Release Notes_ for exact version support for the release.

NOTE: The upgrade process is nearly identical to the installation, and the proceeding instructions will note where the two processes delineate.
