# Install compute nodes

Perform this procedure to install SHS on compute nodes. This procedure can be used for systems that use either Mellanox NICs or HPE Slingshot 200Gbps NICs.

The installation method will depend on what type of NIC is installed on the system.
Select one of the following procedures depending on the NIC in use:

- **Systems using Mellanox NICs**:
- **Systems using HPE Slingshot 200Gbps NICs**:

NOTE: The upgrade process is nearly identical to the installation, and the proceeding instructions will note where the two processes diverge.
