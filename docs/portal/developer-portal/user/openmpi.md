# OpenMPI and applications compiled with OpenMPI

OpenMPI supports Libfabric, and the OpenMPI community has been adding optimizations for the HPE Slingshot NIC to OpenMPI 5.0.x and main branches to the HPE Slingshot NIC as described in the following external paper: [Open MPI for HPE Cray EX Systems](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1997634).

OpenMPI users need to engage with the community for support on running OpenMPI on the HPE Slingshot NIC.
