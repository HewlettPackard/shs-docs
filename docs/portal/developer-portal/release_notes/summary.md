Note:Â  Blanca Peak nodes may crash when using LNet. Starting in USS 1.2.0 the recommended configuration for the iommu.passthough kernel parameter was changed. The iommu.passthrough=y configuration was removed from aarch64 boot parameters to allow the NVIDIA drivers to use the IOMMU with GPU devices. This change allowed the default to be used which could take on either passthrough or no values. This exposed a kfi_cxi bug on ARM blades running LNet (with Lustre or DVS over LNet) if iommu.passthough was not configured to be enabled. This applies both to directly connected Lustre using LNET or an LNET router going from kfi to k2oib (Infiniband Back end Lustre). This will impact non-arm blades if IOMMU needs to be enabled.

Starting with SHS v12.0.1, kfi_cxi will support either device IOMMU or passthrough.
