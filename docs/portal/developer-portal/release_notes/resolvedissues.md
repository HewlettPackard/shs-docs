|ID|Description|Impact|Component|Affected Version/s|
|:--:|:---------|:---------|:----|:----|
|3164400|Documentation for modifying cxi-ss1 driver load in CSM install|For documentation on modifying the cxi-ss1 driver load procedure on CSM systems, please review the IOMMU configuration section (6.11.3) of the HPE Slingshot Host Software Administration Guide.|Documentation|SHS v12.0.2|
|3167756|Ethernet performance when running iperf with multiple flows is not getting full performance|eth-tuning.sh was enhanced to set smp\_affinity\_list, aligning NIC's TX/RX IRQs with NUMA-local CPUs. This change when running iperf2 test with multiple flows(8-128) is now getting better performance|cxieth|SHS v11.0.0|
|3131398|Libfabric CXI provider missing cuda P2P sync\_memops|This change addresses a scenario where overlapping CUDA P2P RDMA access and memory copies to the same buffer could lead to data integrity risks if buffers are not properly synchronized. This update ensures that, even in cases where synchronization is missed in user code, the libfabric layer handles operations safely to prevent race conditions and maintain reliable behavior.|cxiprov|SHS v11.1.0<br>  SHS v12.0.0|
|3125884|CXI Communication Profile Leak|A cxi\_ss1 driver refcounting issue was introduced in SHS 12.0.0 that could cause Communication Profile resources to be leaked when reused. This is fixed in 12.0.2 and 13.0.0|cxicore|SHS v12.0.1<br>  SHS v13.0.0|
|3115956|slingshot-cxi-drivers-install script does not work 100% in slingshot-utils|The IOMMU configuration tools introduced in 12.0.1 required that the regular Slingshot Host Software udev rules and dracut configuration not be installed, and could potentially fail on nodes with multiple Slingshot NICs. This release revises the configuration script to coexist with the regular udev rules and dracut configuration, and properly supports multiple-NIC nodes.|cxilib|SHS v12.0.1|
|3111597|NCCL performance at large node counts|This change has been found to mainly improve *CCL performance over large collective message sizes. It is enabled by default when the FI\_CXI\_RDZV\_PROTO=alt\_read is enabled. If application wishes to disable the use of the additional alt\_read hardware resource it should set FI\_CXI\_DISABLE\_ALT\_READ\_CMDQ=1.|cxiprov|SHS v12.0.1|
|3092835|Retune CXI Resource Reservations for Incasts|A driver change that affects 12.0.0 and 12.0.1 caused a performance issues that were particularly observable under incast-heavy traffic patterns at larger scales than internal testing could accommodate. This is now fixed.|cxicore|SHS v12.0.0|
|3088649|Retry Handler mount point becomes inaccessible after modifying the log level.|In SHS 12.0.0 and 12.0.1 - restarting the CXI Retry Handler would fail. This is now resolved.|cxirh|SHS v12.0.0|
|3063291|Slow NCCL performance using alt\_read rendezvous protocol|Without the associated fix, NCCL performance using the alt\_read rendezvous protocol will be lower than expected.|cxiprov<br>  libfabric|SHS v12.0.1|
|2970621|libfabric CXI provider does not properly dlopen of libcurl and libjson-c|Libfabric CXI provider has hard linking requirements against libcurl and libjson-c. This can create conflicts for containerized applications which different versions of these libraries resulting in the application being unable to launch.|libfabric|SHS v11.0.0|
|2926686|Tx queues need quiesce on close.|This bug presents as a kernel panic during Ethernet operations when the links are being stopped or started with concurrent streams in flight.  The stop could be due to the link dropping, or being dropped due to a link down command or as a side effect of an operation such as modify MTU.  It is a race condition between threads, so incidence is intermittent.  The fix ensures that Ethernet traffic is quiesced through all layers of the Ethernet stack, and not just in the CXI driver.  |cxieth|Slingshot v2.1.3|
|2777021|Crash in kcxi\_cq\_work\_process\_event() with iommu.passthrough set off|Resolves crash in kfi\_cxi on aarch64 nodes when kernel parameter iommu.passthrough is off.|kcxiprov|Slingshot v2.1.1<br>  SHS v11.0.0|
