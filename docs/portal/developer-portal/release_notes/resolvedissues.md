|ID|Description|Impact|Component|Affected Version/s|
|:--:|:---------|:---------|:----|:----|
|2323556|Add link down reason counters entry to debugfs|Add a software counters entry to debugfs to improve visibility of link down reasons, FEC rate errors, serdes firmware reloads, and more: '/sys/kernel/debug/cxi/<cxi#>/counters'|Cassini ASIC|Slingshot v2.1.0|
|2473456|Incorrect RPM names in Slingshot Operations Guide for Mellanox OFED on RHEL|In previous versions of the Slingshot documentation, Slingshot Host Software listed the incorrect name for specific Mellanox OFED RPMs in the instructions for RedHat Distributions. This has been corrected going forward. |Documentation<br>  Mellanox OFED|slingshot v2.1.1|
|2498768|kernel panic in sles15sp5 and rhel8.8 in applications making high memory registration counts|On the platforms sle15sp5+ and rhel 8.8+, a missed call to iova\_domain\_init\_rcaches() during initialization of the iova domain can lead to a kernel panic. The problem is fixed by making a separate call to iova\_domain\_init\_rcaches() during initialization of the iova domain.<br>  This was encountered when applications were making high registration counts causing the kernel iova subsystem to access an uninitialized variable.|cxicore|Slingshot v2.1.1|
|2433354|Nodes hanging after a CXI error with a SoftRoCE stack|In some occurrences, an undersized event queue in the Ethernet driver led to transmit queues being frozen. This has been fixed by resizing the event queue.|cxicore|Slingshot v2.1.0<br>  Slingshot v2.1.1|
|2475117|Optimize the Cassini-1 read of initialization data from flash|This change increases the Cassini Pre-Fetch size to 2040B from 128B.  This change optimizes the Cassini read of initialization data from the QSPI flash on the card in the event of a recovered or unrecovered ECC error being detected on the QSPI flash.  Cassini firmware 1.5.49 or greater needs to be installed.|Cas1 - FW|Slingshot v2.1.1|
|2469711|Cassini-1 UEFI driver exception with firmware 1.5.47|This change enables compression on the UEFI driver.  This change allows BIOS to complete, even when it detects a CRC error in the UEFI driver due to a recovered or unrecovered ECC error being detected on the QSPI flash.  Cassini firmware 1.5.49 or greater needs to be installed.|Cas1 - UEFI|Slingshot v2.1.1|
|2240307|Cassini-1 does not enumerate on the PCIe bus|This change adds support for the microcontroller (uC) on the Cassini mezzanine card to reload the Cassini SerDes firmware upon request from the node controller (nC).   This problem is caused by a clock "glitch", and the Cassini will not enumerate on the PCIe bus.  This also requires updated node BIOS and (nC) firmware that is available in the HPC Firmware Pack (HFP), firmware version 23.9.0.   There is no install order dependencies, but both HFP v23.9 and Cassini firmware 1.5.47 or greater needs to be installed before the feature is fully functional.<br>  |Cas1 - FW|Slingshot v1.7.0|
