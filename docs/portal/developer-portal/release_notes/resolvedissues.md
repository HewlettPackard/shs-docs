|3279093|Default rendezvous eager size inadvertently changed from 2K to 16K|The default setting for FI\_CXI\_RDZV\_EAGER\_SIZE was returned to 2048 from the SHS-13.0 setting of 16384 and the fi\_cxi.7. There is no change with explicit setting of FI\_CXI\_RDZV\_EAGER\_SIZE, it was previously and will be continued to be honored. The default for FI\_CXI\_RDZV\_THRESHOLD remains 16384. When rendezvous criteria are met, FI\_CXI\_RDZV\_EAGER\_SIZE data is sent with the put, while the remainder is read with a get.|cxiprov<br>  libfabric|SHS v13.0.0|
|3274076|fi\_cxi man page needs correction|An error in the FI\_CXI\_RDZV\_GET\_MIN section of the fi\_cxi man page was corrected.  "FI\_CXI\_RDZV\_THRESHOLD" was replaced with "FI\_CXI\_EAGER\_SIZE".|libfabric|SHS v13.0.0|
|3212093|CUDA, enable dmabuf by default for driver 580.x and beyond. |DMAbuf for cuda devices is now the default for CXI provider. This requires the nvidia 580+ driver.|libfabric|SHS v13.0.0|
|3197928|Blanca Peak nodes crashing in cass\_rgid\_put|Problem description: Freeing RGIDs out of order exposed null ptr dereference.<br>  Description of fix: Fix free of rgid when encountering unused entry.<br>  Impact of including: Normal operation is restored.<br>  Impact of not including: Some usage patterns of RGID sharing caused a kernel panic.|cxicore|SHS v12.0.1|
|3158779|fix requirements.txt for pycxi|A python dependency for the cxiutil utility has been corrected. In previous versions, if the "docopt" package was not already installed, cxiutil would throw an exception regarding the missing package. |pycxi|SHS v13.0.0|
|2984786|Rate limit number of kdreg2 kernel messages a user-space client can trigger|Control the frequency of kernel messages using rate limiting. Introduced a new feature allowing configuration of a custom log level for kdreg2, providing finer control over log verbosity.<br>  Configure using /sys/class/kdreg2/kdreg2/log\_level. Default is LOGLEVEL\_DEBUG (7).|kdreg2|SHS v11.0.0|
|2943066|Improve fi\_cntr\_wait for threaded processes|The experimental use of the environment variable FI\_CXI\_CNTR\_TRIG\_CMDQ was added that enables dedicated triggered command queue for bound counters when using FI\_THREAD\_SAFE or FI\_THREAD\_COMPLETION threading models. This can improve the performance multithreaded counter operations at the cost of command queue resources. This option is disabled by default.|cxiprov<br>  libfabric|SHS v12.0.0|
