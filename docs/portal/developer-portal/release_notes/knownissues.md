|ID|Description|Workaround|
|:--:|:---------|:---------|
|2160777|Libfabric XRC support is non-functional in all versions of MOFED, including MOFED 24.10.|Use UCX instead of Libfabric with XRC until the root cause is identified and resolved by the Nvidia team. <br>  When using the open-source Libfabric, you must set FI\_VERBS\_PREFER\_XRC=0 for MPI jobs with 64 or more ranks to avoid core dumps.|
|2964859|H/W Offloaded FI\_CLAIM of unexpected message header onload results in abort|This problem can be avoided by running with FI\_CXI\_RX\_MATCH\_MODE=software match mode. At this time, FI\_CLAIM generally runs faster when running with software EP matching and is the recommended mode when FI\_CLAIM is heavily used. |
|2953827|Broken EQ wait object support that is required for some utilities or fabtests|Certain tests and utilities (e.g. utility/pingpong.c) require a EQ wait object; either specified by setting FI\_WAIT\_UNSPEC or FI\_WAIT\_FD in the EQ attributes.  The existing provider removed function incorrect support for FI\_WAIT\_FD for EQ objects. A test that allows for disabling EQ wait objects could utilize that setting to work around this issue. Support for EQ FI\_WAIT\_YIELD wait objects will be added.|
|2940305|shs diag reports libkmod error on RHEL images|Ignore the `10-unsupported-modules.conf` error for Mellanox installations; it will be addressed in the next release.|
|2874751|fi\_pingpong, fi\_info command may fail on RHEL-9.4 |Manually set the `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to ensure proper environment setup:   <br>  <br>  export PATH=/opt/cray/libfabric/1.22.0/bin:$PATH<br>  export LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=/opt/cray/libfabric/1.22.0/lib64:$LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH<br>  <br>  The default environment paths are not being set correctly. Although a module file exists, nothing is loading it into the environment. To resolve this, either explicitly set the paths as shown above or ensure the module is correctly loaded.<br>  <br>  Example assumes you are using Libfabric 1.22.0. Adjust the version number if using a different release.|
|2913069|cxi\_healthcheck failures with python-3.8 or lower|If multiple Python versions are installed on your system and the default points to a version lower than 3.9, you need to update the default to a higher version or create a symbolic link to the required version. Below is an example of how to achieve this using the update-alternatives tool:<br>  # find which python version has cxi installed<br>  find /usr/lib64/. -name cxi<br>  # example output says: /usr/lib64/./python3.9/site-packages/cxi<br>  <br>  # Add the required Python version to alternatives<br>  update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.9 1<br>  <br>  # Configure alternatives to set the preferred Python 3 version<br>  update-alternatives --config python3<br>  <br>  # Verify the updated default version<br>  python3 --version|
|2858448|Inconsistency observed in cxi\_send\_lat test when using the -D option.|Avoid using the -D option. Run the cxi\_send\_lat test with the default command instead.|
|2842694|Disable ATS for Antero Turin on SLES15SP5|This workaround applies specifically to the Antreo Turin processor. For SP5 and COS-Base 3.1 builds running on a Turin processor, add the kernel parameter cxi\_ss1.enable\_ats=0 to the OS image (or cxi\_core.enable\_ats=0 if using Slingshot-2.2.0, SHS 11.0.0, or SHS 11.0.1). Note that this is required only for SP5 and COS-Base 3.1, as ATS is disabled by default for SP6 starting from version SHS 11.1.0|
|2820736| RHEL image fails on python3-docopt dependency |When installing RHEL Images, Add EPEL (Extended Packages for Enterprise Linux) repository to download python3-docopt |
|2739776|Update the RPM list to use exact versions of RPMS |When installing 2.1.3, update the RPM list to use the specific versions of libfabric and msflint provided in the Slingshot Host Software tar file. The distribution supplies newer versions, but we are shipping libfabric 1.15 and msflint 4.16. Therefore, the RPM list must be amended to use the specific versions provided in the tar file.|
|2730631|HSN IP's are not reachable after configuring HSN interface MTU size|The Ethernet MTU must be configured before setting up Traffic Classes. If Traffic Classes settings are applied and the MTU is modified while live traffic is present, the device may cease transmitting packets.|
|2724588|Enable ATS for sles15sp6/linux 6.4|Due to the absence of the iommu\_v2 module in Linux kernel 6.4, ATS has been disabled by default for SLES15SP6 and COS-Base 3.2. This will be resolved in upcoming releases.|
|2706052|HPCM-1.10 and 1.11 will require to specify libcxi version to be installed |When installing the Libcxi RPM on HPCM-1.10 and HPCM-1.11, specify the complete libcxi version of the RPM provided in the distribution tar file.<br>  |
|2215092|libfabric MR cache with memhooks may deadlock with CUDA and ROCM/ROCR|When doing RDMA with device memory, memhooks cannot be used as the system memory monitor. Either userfaultfd or HPE provided kdreg2 need to be used. The following environment variables are used to select these two memory monitors respectively.<br>  FI\_MR\_CACHE\_MONITOR=userfaultfd<br>  FI\_MR\_CACHE\_MONITOR=kdreg2|
