|2160777|Libfabric XRC support is non-functional in all versions of MOFED, including MOFED 24.10.|Use UCX instead of Libfabric with XRC until the root cause is identified and resolved by the Nvidia team. <br>  When using the open-source Libfabric, you must set FI\_VERBS\_PREFER\_XRC=0 for MPI jobs with 64 or more ranks to avoid core dumps.|
|3032601|cxiutil fails on SLES15SP6 and COS-Base-3.3 due to missing python3-docopt package|For SLES15SP6 and COS-Base 3.3, install the appropriate `docopt` package for the Python version used by `cxi`:  <br>  <br>  1. Find the Python version with `cxi` packages installed:  <br>     ```bash<br>     find /usr/lib64/. -name cxi<br>     ```  <br>  2. Check the output (e.g., `/usr/lib64/python3.11/site-packages/cxi`) to determine the Python version.  <br>  3. Install the corresponding `docopt` RPM (e.g., `python3.11-docopt`).<br>  |

|3110032|Using the cxi\_service utility to update VNIs does not work|As of SHS 13.0 updating VNIs of an existing CXI Service is not supported. Using the cxi\_service utility to update VNIs will not work|
|2983849|"show cables" error caused by missing cxi driver functionnality:  ethtool -m returns netlink error: Invalid argument|The RHEL 8.6, RHEL 8.7 & SLES15 SP4 `ethtool` leads to Slingshot Topology Tool functionality issue. The `show cables` does not return correct data. For STT to function correctly, we recommend following versions of `ethtool` to be installed. For RHEL and Rocky, use `ethtool` 5.16 (ethtool-5.16-1.el9.x86\_64) and above. For SLES15SP4, use `ethtool` 5.9 (ethtool-5.9-1.31.x86\_64). NOTE: These versions of `ethtool` are not available as part of the default RHEL/SLES distributions and will need to be downloaded and installed separately.|
|2913069|cxi\_healthcheck failures with python-3.8 or lower|If multiple Python versions are installed on your system and the default points to a version lower than 3.9, you need to update the default to a higher version or create a symbolic link to the required version. Below is an example of how to achieve this using the update-alternatives tool:<br>  # find which python version has cxi installed<br>  find /usr/lib64/. -name cxi<br>  # example output says: /usr/lib64/./python3.9/site-packages/cxi<br>  <br>  # Add the required Python version to alternatives<br>  update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.9 1<br>  <br>  # Configure alternatives to set the preferred Python 3 version<br>  update-alternatives --config python3<br>  <br>  # Verify the updated default version<br>  python3 --version|
|2858448|Inconsistency observed in cxi\_send\_lat test when using the -D option.|Avoid using the -D option. Run the cxi\_send\_lat test with the default command instead.|
|2802789|Slingshot 400GB Switch: The assignment of AMA to the HSNx interface requires rebooting nodes.|For Slingshot 400GBps Switches:  <br>  <br>  All the assigned MAC addresses on node HSNx interfaces start with 02:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX<br>  If baseMacPrefix is changed to "06" HSNx AMA addresses on the nodes start with 06:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX<br>  <br>  To get AMA assigned to the HSN interfaces, it requires all the connected nodes to the switch fabric to be rebooted.|
|2724588|Enable ATS for sles15sp6/linux 6.4|Due to the absence of the iommu\_v2 module in Linux kernel 6.4, ATS has been disabled by default for SLES15SP6 and COS-Base 3.2. This will be resolved in upcoming releases.|
|2706052|HPCM-1.10 and 1.11 will require users to specify libcxi version to be installed |When installing the Libcxi RPM on HPCM-1.10 and HPCM-1.11, specify the complete libcxi version of the RPM provided in the distribution tar file.<br>  |
|2215092|libfabric MR cache with memhooks may deadlock with CUDA and ROCM/ROCR|When doing RDMA with device memory, memhooks cannot be used as the system memory monitor. Either userfaultfd or HPE provided kdreg2 need to be used. The following environment variables are used to select these two memory monitors respectively.<br>  FI\_MR\_CACHE\_MONITOR=userfaultfd<br>  FI\_MR\_CACHE\_MONITOR=kdreg2|
