## 200Gbps NIC State

200Gbps NIC is functioning in a degraded state.

## Actions

At the bare minimum, the NIC must be power cycled (cold reset), which typically requires a node power cycle, to reset the NIC to not be functioning in a degraded state. Frequent errors is a sign hardware may have to be replaced.
