# HSN Performance

HPE Slingshot is a network fabric consisting of fabric agents that manage congestion by performing ASIC operations on specific HPE Slingshot switches across the HPC system.

The hardware tracks all active network packets and identifies and controls causes of congestion by:

- Isolating packet congestion between endpoint pairs and protecting other traffic flows from impact
- Reduction in tail latency
- Ensuring predictable runtimes for HPC jobs
