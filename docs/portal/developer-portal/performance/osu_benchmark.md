# OSU Benchmark

OSU Benchmark is a collection of MPI test suites that enable to collect key performance metrics (Bandwidth, Latency) for HPC Fabrics. They can operate on any of the standard MPI implementations.
OSU Micro-Benchmarks provide several different type of benchmarks that can be used to test and measure HPC network performance:

* Point-to-Point MPI Benchmarks: Latency, multi-threaded latency, multi-pair latency, multiple bandwidth / message rate test bandwidth, bidirectional bandwidth
* One-sided MPI Benchmarks: one-sided put latency, one-sided put bandwidth, one-sided put bidirectional bandwidth, one-sided get latency, one-sided get bandwidth, one-sided accumulate latency
