# OSU benchmark

OSU benchmark is a collection of MPI test suites collecting key performance metrics (bandwidth, latency) for HPC Fabrics, and is supported on standard MPI implementations.

OSU micro-benchmarks provides the following tests to measure HPC network performance:

**Point-to-point MPI benchmarks:**

- Latency
- Multi-threaded latency
- Multi-pair latency
- Multiple bandwidth / message rate test bandwidth
- Bidirectional bandwidth

**One-sided MPI benchmarks:**

- One-sided put latency
- One-sided put bandwidth
- One-sided put bidirectional bandwidth
- One-sided get latency
- One-sided get bandwidth
- One-sided accumulate latency
