# HSN Performance Overview

HPE Slingshot is a network fabric consisting of fabric agents responsible for performing ASIC operations on specific Slingshot switches for the purpose of managing network congestion across an HPC system.

The hardware tracks all active network packets and identifies and controls causes of congestion by:

- Isolating packet congestion between endpoint pairs and protecting other traffic flows from impact
- Reduction in tail latency
- Ensuring predictable runtimes for HPC jobs
