# Fabric Health Diagnostics

HPE recommends using the Slingshot Topology Tool (STT) and then refer to the sections that describe analyzing link flaps and cable hardware problems to troubleshoot the fabric.

Use the following commands to analyze the performance variations:

- `show switches`
- `show switch ports`
- `show fabric`
